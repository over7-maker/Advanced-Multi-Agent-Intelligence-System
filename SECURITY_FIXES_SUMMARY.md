# AMAS Security Fixes Summary

## 🔒 Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

This document summarizes all security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed in the AMAS system to make it production-ready and enterprise-grade.

## 🚨 Critical Security Issues Resolved

### 1. **Code Injection via eval() Usage** - CRITICAL
**Issue**: Unsafe `eval()` usage in security modules could lead to code injection attacks.

**Files Affected**:
- `src/amas/security/audit.py`
- `src/amas/security/authorization.py`

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Replaced `eval()` with safe string-based condition evaluation
- ✅ Implemented `_safe_evaluate_condition()` method
- ✅ Added input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Removed all dynamic code execution

**Security Impact**: **CRITICAL** - Prevents remote code execution attacks

### 2. **Weak Cryptographic Hashing** - HIGH
**Issue**: MD5 hashing used for correlation IDs is cryptographically weak.

**Files Affected**:
- `src/amas/security/audit.py`

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Replaced MD5 with SHA-256 for correlation ID generation
- ✅ Updated hash function to use `hashlib.sha256()`
- ✅ Maintained same output length for compatibility

**Security Impact**: **HIGH** - Prevents hash collision attacks

### 3. **Hardcoded Secrets in Database Service** - HIGH
**Issue**: Database passwords and credentials hardcoded in service configuration.

**Files Affected**:
- `src/amas/services/database_service.py`

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Implemented environment variable usage for all sensitive data
- ✅ Added fallback to configuration with secure defaults
- ✅ Created secure configuration management system
- ✅ Added configuration validation

**Security Impact**: **HIGH** - Prevents credential exposure
