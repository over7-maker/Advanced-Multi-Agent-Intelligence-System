✅ PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:
================================

🚨 ISSUE 1: MISSING ISSUE NUMBER ARGUMENT
=========================================
Problem: ai_issue_analyzer.py: error: the following arguments are required: --issue-number
Root Cause: Script required --issue-number but workflow didn't provide it for PR events
Solution: Made --issue-number optional with default value "all"
Status: ✅ FIXED

🚨 ISSUE 2: MISSING FINAL SUMMARY SCRIPT
========================================
Problem: ai_issue_final_summary.py script was missing
Root Cause: Script was referenced in workflow but never created
Solution: Created comprehensive ai_issue_final_summary.py script
Status: ✅ FIXED

🚨 ISSUE 3: CYTHON BUILD ERROR (RECURRING)
==========================================
Problem: AttributeError: cython_sources during scikit-learn installation
Root Cause: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib require Cython and numpy to be installed first
Solution: Added Cython numpy dependencies before all scikit-learn installations
Status: ✅ FIXED
