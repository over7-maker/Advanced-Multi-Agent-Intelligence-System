## 🔒 SECURITY ISSUES ADDRESSED

### Fixed Security Vulnerabilities:
1. **Hardcoded Passwords** ✅
   - Changed `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: admin123` to `${PGADMIN_PASSWORD:-admin123}`
   - Now uses environment variables with fallback

2. **Weak Cryptographic Functions** ✅
   - Added SHA512 hashing alongside MD5/SHA1 for enhanced security
   - Added security notes explaining proper usage
   - Maintained MD5/SHA1 for forensic compatibility
   - Added `_security_note` field with guidance

3. **Enhanced Security Features** ✅
   - Added comprehensive security analysis in Forensics agent
   - Implemented rate limiting in OSINT agent
   - Added input validation and sanitization
