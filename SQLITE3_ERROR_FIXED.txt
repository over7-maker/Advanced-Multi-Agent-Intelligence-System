✅ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
=====================
The GitHub Actions workflow was failing with:
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement sqlite3 (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for sqlite3

🔧 ROOT CAUSE:
==============
• sqlite3 is a built-in Python module
• It should NOT be installed via pip
• All workflow files were trying to install it with: pip install aiohttp requests pyyaml sqlite3

🛠️ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
========================
• Removed 'sqlite3' from all pip install commands
• Changed: pip install aiohttp requests pyyaml sqlite3
• To: pip install aiohttp requests pyyaml
• sqlite3 is now used as a built-in module (no installation needed)
