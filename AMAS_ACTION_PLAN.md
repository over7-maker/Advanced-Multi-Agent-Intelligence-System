# ðŸš€ AMAS Multi-Agent System - Action Plan & Capabilities

## ðŸ“Š Current Status

Based on the GitHub PR context and our analysis, your Advanced Multi-Agent Intelligence System (AMAS) is a sophisticated platform with the following components:

### âœ… What We've Fixed

1. **API Authentication Issues**
   - Identified that your API keys are OpenRouter keys (sk-or-v1-*)
   - Created validation scripts to test API connectivity
   - Confirmed DeepSeek model works through OpenRouter
   - Built a unified AI router with fallback mechanisms

2. **Consolidated Orchestrators**
   - Merged multiple orchestrator implementations into one unified system
   - Created a standardized agent role system
   - Implemented intelligent model routing and fallback

3. **Robust Fallback Mechanism**
   - Built automatic failover between AI models
   - Supports OpenRouter, direct APIs, and local models
   - Tracks model health and automatically disables failing models

## ðŸŽ¯ What You Can Do With This System

### 1. **Automated Code Analysis & Improvement**
```bash
# Run comprehensive code analysis
python scripts/run_unified_orchestrator.py
```
- Analyzes code quality, architecture, and performance
- Suggests refactoring opportunities
- Identifies security vulnerabilities
- Generates improvement roadmaps

### 2. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**
The system coordinates multiple specialized agents:
- **Code Analyst**: Reviews code quality and architecture
- **Security Expert**: Identifies vulnerabilities
- **Performance Optimizer**: Finds bottlenecks
- **Documentation Specialist**: Generates docs
- **Project Manager**: Creates actionable plans

### 3. **Intelligence Gathering & OSINT**
```python
# Use for threat intelligence
orchestrator.execute_task(
    title="Threat Intelligence Gathering",
    description="Analyze potential security threats",
    required_agents=[AgentRole.INTELLIGENCE_GATHERER, AgentRole.OSINT_COLLECTOR]
)
```

### 4. **Automated Incident Response**
- Triage security incidents
- Generate response plans
- Coordinate mitigation strategies

## ðŸ“‹ Immediate Actions You Can Take

### 1. **Configure OpenRouter Properly**
```bash
# Visit https://openrouter.ai/settings/privacy
# Configure your data retention policy to enable more models
```

### 2. **Add More API Keys**
Create a `.env` file with additional providers:
```env
# Existing OpenRouter keys
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-key

# Add direct API keys for better reliability
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
CLAUDE_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-claude-key
```

### 3. **Set Up Local Models (Offline Operation)**
```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Pull models
ollama pull llama3.1:70b
ollama pull codellama:34b
```

### 4. **Run the Unified Orchestrator**
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run orchestrator demo
python scripts/run_unified_orchestrator.py

# Run API validation
python scripts/validate_api_config.py
```

## ðŸ”§ Advanced Capabilities

### 1. **Custom Agent Workflows**
Create specialized workflows for your use cases:

```python
from amas.core.unified_orchestrator import get_orchestrator, AgentRole

orchestrator = get_orchestrator()

# Custom security audit workflow
await orchestrator.execute_task(
    title="Complete Security Audit",
    description="Perform comprehensive security analysis",
    required_agents=[
        AgentRole.SECURITY_EXPERT,
        AgentRole.CODE_ANALYST,
        AgentRole.INCIDENT_RESPONDER
    ],
    parameters={
        "scan_depth": "deep",
        "include_dependencies": True
    }
)
```

### 2. **Continuous Monitoring**
Set up automated analysis cycles:

```python
# Schedule regular project analysis
async def continuous_improvement():
    while True:
        results = await orchestrator.analyze_project("/workspace")
        report = await orchestrator.generate_improvement_report(results)
        # Send report or create GitHub issues
        await asyncio.sleep(86400)  # Daily
```

### 3. **GitHub Integration**
Automate PR reviews and issue management:

```python
# Auto-review pull requests
async def review_pr(pr_number):
    code_diff = get_pr_diff(pr_number)
    
    review = await orchestrator.execute_task(
        title=f"Review PR #{pr_number}",
        description="Analyze code changes for quality and security",
        required_agents=[
            AgentRole.CODE_ANALYST,
            AgentRole.SECURITY_EXPERT,
            AgentRole.QUALITY_ASSURANCE
        ],
        parameters={"diff": code_diff}
    )
    
    post_pr_comment(pr_number, format_review(review))
```

## ðŸŽ® Try These Commands Now

1. **Test Your Setup**
   ```bash
   python scripts/test_openrouter_direct.py
   ```

2. **Validate All APIs**
   ```bash
   python scripts/validate_api_config.py
   ```

3. **Run Full Orchestration Demo**
   ```bash
   python scripts/run_unified_orchestrator.py
   ```

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Short Term (This Week)**
   - Configure OpenRouter data retention settings
   - Add at least one direct API key (OpenAI or Claude)
   - Run the orchestrator demo to see agents in action
   - Review generated improvement reports

2. **Medium Term (This Month)**
   - Set up Ollama for offline operation
   - Create custom workflows for your specific needs
   - Implement the monitoring dashboard
   - Integrate with your CI/CD pipeline

3. **Long Term (Quarter)**
   - Build custom agents for domain-specific tasks
   - Create a web UI for easier management
   - Implement advanced features like:
     - Agent memory and learning
     - Cross-project knowledge sharing
     - Automated code generation

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **Optimize Costs**: Use DeepSeek through OpenRouter for most tasks (very cost-effective)
2. **Improve Reliability**: Add multiple API providers for redundancy
3. **Enhance Privacy**: Set up local models for sensitive code analysis
4. **Scale Up**: The system supports horizontal scaling for large projects

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

If agents aren't working:
1. Check API keys in `.env`
2. Verify OpenRouter account has credits
3. Run `python scripts/validate_api_config.py`
4. Check logs in `logs/` directory
