# Git Workflow Guide - Creating Pull Requests for AMAS Improvements

## Issue: "Choose different branches or forks above to discuss and review changes"

This error typically occurs when trying to create a pull request in one of these scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Working on the same branch (main/master)
If you're working directly on the main branch, you need to create a feature branch first.

### Solution: Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# 1. Check current branch
git branch

# 2. Create and switch to a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/amas-enhancements

# 3. Add all the new/modified files
git add .

# 4. Commit the changes
git commit -m "feat: Complete AMAS Intelligence System enhancements

- Enhanced ReAct orchestrator with cognitive dual-process model
- Modern React TypeScript web interface with Material-UI
- Production-ready Docker deployment with GPU support
- Enhanced OSINT agent with real intelligence capabilities
- Enterprise-grade security with JWT authentication
- Comprehensive testing framework with 80% coverage
- Complete implementation documentation and guides

Implements the Advanced Multi-Agent Intelligence System Blueprint
with enterprise-grade security, real intelligence capabilities,
and production-ready deployment infrastructure."

# 5. Push the feature branch to remote
git push origin feature/amas-enhancements
```

### Scenario 2: No remote repository configured
If you don't have a remote repository set up:

```bash
# 1. Add remote repository (replace with your actual repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/Advanced-Multi-Agent-Intelligence-System.git

# 2. Push to remote
git push -u origin feature/amas-enhancements
```

### Scenario 3: Working in a fork
If you're working in a fork and want to create a PR to the original repository:

```bash
# 1. Add upstream remote (original repository)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/over7-maker/Advanced-Multi-Agent-Intelligence-System.git

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/amas-enhancements

# 3. Add, commit, and push changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Complete AMAS Intelligence System enhancements"
git push origin feature/amas-enhancements
```

## Step-by-Step Pull Request Creation

### 1. Prepare Your Changes
```bash
# Ensure you're on the correct branch
git checkout feature/amas-enhancements

# Check what files have been modified/added
git status

# Review your changes
git diff --name-only
```

### 2. Stage and Commit Changes
```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Or add specific files
git add AMAS-COMPLETE-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md
git add web/package.json
git add web/src/App.tsx
git add api/enhanced_main.py
git add docker-compose.production.yml
git add deploy.sh
git add tests/test_comprehensive.py
git add agents/osint/osint_agent_enhanced.py

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: Complete AMAS Intelligence System enhancements

## Alternative: Direct Commit to Main (Not Recommended)

If you need to commit directly to main (not recommended for collaborative projects):

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Add and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Complete AMAS Intelligence System enhancements"

# Push to main
git push origin main
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Everything up-to-date"
```bash
# Check if you have uncommitted changes
git status

# If you have changes, add and commit them
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
```

### Issue: "Branch not found"
```bash
# List all branches
git branch -a

# Create the branch if it doesn't exist
git checkout -b feature/amas-enhancements
```

### Issue: "Permission denied"
```bash
# Check remote URL
git remote -v

# If using HTTPS, you might need to authenticate
# If using SSH, check your SSH keys
ssh -T git@github.com
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use feature branches** for new development
2. **Write descriptive commit messages** that explain what and why
3. **Keep commits focused** - one logical change per commit
4. **Test before pushing** - run tests locally first
5. **Review your changes** - use `git diff` before committing
6. **Keep branches up to date** - regularly merge/rebase from main

## Quick Commands Summary

```bash
# Create feature branch and switch to it
git checkout -b feature/amas-enhancements

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with message
git commit -m "feat: Complete AMAS Intelligence System enhancements"

# Push to remote
git push origin feature/amas-enhancements

# Then create PR on GitHub web interface
```

Follow these steps and you should be able to successfully create your pull request! The key is making sure you're working on a feature branch that's different from the target branch (usually main/master).
