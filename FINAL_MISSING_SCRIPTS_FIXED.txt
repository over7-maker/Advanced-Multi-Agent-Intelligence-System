üîß THE ULTIMATE GITIGNORE FIX FORMULA:
=====================================
```
# The Ultimate Fix for .gitignore:
# Instead of:
*final_*.py  # ‚ùå This ignores all files with "final" in the name

# Use:
*final_*.py

# Exception: Allow .github/scripts/ files
!.github/scripts/
!.github/scripts/*

# This ensures:
# - General patterns still work for temporary files
# - .github/scripts/ files are always allowed
# - No more missing script file errors
# - All workflows can find their required scripts
```
