## Disaster Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Complete System Failure

**Description**: Total loss of production environment due to hardware failure, data center outage, or catastrophic event.

**Impact**: 
- Complete service unavailability
- All data potentially lost
- Business operations halted

**Recovery Strategy**:
1. Activate disaster recovery site
2. Restore from off-site backups
3. Rebuild infrastructure
4. Validate system functionality

### Scenario 2: Database Corruption

**Description**: Database corruption due to hardware failure, software bugs, or malicious activity.

**Impact**:
- Data integrity compromised
- Application errors
- Potential data loss

**Recovery Strategy**:
1. Stop affected services
2. Restore from latest clean backup
3. Apply transaction logs if available
4. Validate data integrity

### Scenario 3: Partial Service Failure

**Description**: Failure of individual services or components while others remain operational.

**Impact**:
- Degraded functionality
- User experience affected
- Some features unavailable

**Recovery Strategy**:
1. Isolate failed components
2. Restart or replace services
3. Restore from backups if needed
4. Monitor system stability

### Scenario 4: Security Breach

**Description**: Unauthorized access, data breach, or malicious activity affecting system integrity.

**Impact**:
- Data confidentiality compromised
- System integrity at risk
- Potential legal and regulatory issues

**Recovery Strategy**:
1. Immediate system isolation
2. Forensic analysis
3. Data restoration from clean backups
4. Security hardening
5. Incident reporting

## Recovery Procedures

### Pre-Disaster Preparation

#### 1. Backup Verification

```bash
# Verify backup integrity
./scripts/backup.sh --environment production --type full --verify

# Test restore procedures
./scripts/restore.sh --environment staging --backup latest --type full --verify
```

#### 2. Disaster Recovery Testing

```bash
# Run disaster recovery test
./scripts/test-disaster-recovery.sh --scenario complete-failure

# Validate recovery procedures
./scripts/validate-recovery.sh --environment staging
```

#### 3. Documentation Updates

- Review and update recovery procedures
- Verify contact information
- Update system documentation
- Test communication channels

### Immediate Response (0-15 minutes)

#### 1. Incident Assessment

```bash
# Check system status
./scripts/validate-deployment.sh --environment production --type basic

# Check service health
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-blue.yml ps

# Review logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-blue.yml logs --tail=100
```

#### 2. Initial Response

- Activate incident response team
- Assess scope and impact
- Implement immediate containment measures
- Notify stakeholders

#### 3. Communication

```bash
# Send initial notification
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"text":"ðŸš¨ AMAS DISASTER RECOVERY ACTIVATED - Assessing situation..."}' \
  "$SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL"
```

### Short-term Recovery (15 minutes - 1 hour)

#### 1. Service Restoration

```bash
# Attempt service restart
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-blue.yml restart

# Check service health
./scripts/validate-deployment.sh --environment production --type comprehensive

# If restart fails, proceed to backup restoration
```

#### 2. Backup Restoration

```bash
# List available backups
ls -la backups/production-*

# Restore from latest backup
./scripts/restore.sh --environment production --backup latest --type full --force

# Validate restoration
./scripts/validate-deployment.sh --environment production --type comprehensive
```

#### 3. Data Recovery

```bash
# Restore database
./scripts/restore.sh --environment production --backup latest --type database --force

# Restore application data
./scripts/restore.sh --environment production --backup latest --type config --force

# Restore volumes
./scripts/restore.sh --environment production --backup latest --type volumes --force
```

### Long-term Recovery (1-24 hours)

#### 1. System Stabilization

```bash
# Monitor system performance
./scripts/monitor-system.sh --environment production --duration 3600

```

#### 2. Data Validation

```bash
# Verify data integrity
