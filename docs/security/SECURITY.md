# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

AMAS (Advanced Multi-Agent Intelligence System) takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices, reporting procedures, and commitment to maintaining a secure system.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Core Security Architecture

- **Zero-Trust Model**: Every component requires authentication and authorization
- **End-to-End Encryption**: AES-GCM-256 encryption for all data at rest and in transit
- **Secure by Default**: All security features enabled by default
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive, tamper-evident audit trails
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Fine-grained permission system

### Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest**: All stored data encrypted with AES-GCM-256
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- **Key Management**: Secure key derivation and rotation
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect and store necessary data
- **Secure Deletion**: Cryptographic erasure of sensitive data

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: TOTP and backup codes support
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic expiration
- **Permission Model**: Granular permissions with principle of least privilege
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, and CORS protection

## üîç Supported Versions

We actively support and provide security updates for:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ‚úÖ Active support |
| 0.9.x   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited support |
| < 0.9   | ‚ùå No longer supported |

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

### Reporting Process

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email**: Send details to security@amas.ai
3. **Encrypt**: Use our PGP key for sensitive information (key available on request)
4. **Include**: Detailed description, steps to reproduce, and potential impact

### What to Include

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential security impact and affected components
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: System details (OS, Python version, AMAS version)
- **Evidence**: Screenshots, logs, or proof-of-concept (if safe to share)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours of receipt
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Updates**: Weekly updates until resolution
- **Fix Timeline**: Critical issues within 7 days, others within 30 days

### Disclosure Policy

- **Coordinated Disclosure**: We prefer coordinated disclosure
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available and deployed
- **Credit**: Security researchers will be credited (if desired)
- **Bug Bounty**: Contact us for potential reward information

## üîß Security Configuration

### Production Security Checklist

#### Environment Security
- [ ] Strong, unique passwords for all services
- [ ] JWT secret is cryptographically random (32+ characters)
- [ ] Encryption keys are properly generated and secured
- [ ] All default passwords changed
- [ ] Environment variables properly secured

#### Network Security
- [ ] TLS certificates properly configured
- [ ] Firewall rules restrict unnecessary access
- [ ] VPN or private networks used for internal communication
- [ ] Rate limiting configured appropriately
- [ ] CORS origins restricted to necessary domains

#### Application Security
- [ ] Audit logging enabled and monitored
- [ ] Role-based access control configured
- [ ] Input validation enabled for all endpoints
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information

#### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Regular security updates applied
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Backup encryption enabled
- [ ] Access logs retained and monitored
- [ ] Intrusion detection system active

### Security Configuration Example

```bash
# Strong security configuration
export AMAS_JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
export AMAS_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
export AMAS_AUDIT_ENABLED=true
export AMAS_RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS=100
export AMAS_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=3600

# Database security
export AMAS_DB_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
export AMAS_REDIS_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
export AMAS_NEO4J_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Secure Coding**
   - Always validate and sanitize input data
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations
   - Implement proper error handling without information disclosure
   - Follow OWASP secure coding guidelines

2. **Authentication**
   - Never hardcode credentials in source code
   - Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - Implement proper session management
   - Follow password complexity requirements

3. **Data Handling**
   - Encrypt sensitive data before storage
   - Use secure communication channels
   - Implement proper data retention policies
   - Follow data minimization principles

### For Administrators

1. **System Hardening**
   - Keep all systems and dependencies updated
   - Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts
   - Enable and monitor audit logging
   - Implement network segmentation

2. **Access Control**
   - Follow principle of least privilege
   - Regularly review and update permissions
   - Use multi-factor authentication
   - Monitor for suspicious access patterns

3. **Monitoring**
   - Set up security monitoring and alerting
   - Regularly review audit logs
   - Monitor system performance and anomalies
   - Implement incident response procedures

## üîê Compliance

AMAS is designed to support compliance with various security frameworks:

### Standards Supported
- **ISO 27001**: Information Security Management
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security, Availability, and Confidentiality
- **GDPR**: EU General Data Protection Regulation
- **HIPAA**: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
- **PCI DSS**: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard

### Compliance Features
- **Data Protection**: Comprehensive data protection measures
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access with audit trails
- **Encryption**: Industry-standard encryption throughout
- **Monitoring**: Continuous security monitoring and alerting
- **Documentation**: Complete security documentation and procedures

## üö® Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Local Model Security**: Local LLM models should be verified for integrity
2. **External APIs**: External API integrations require secure key management
3. **Web Interface**: Web UI requires proper CSP and XSS protection
4. **File Uploads**: File upload functionality requires malware scanning

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Model Verification**: Implement model checksum verification
2. **API Security**: Use encrypted storage for API keys
3. **Web Security**: Implement CSP headers and XSS protection
4. **File Security**: Implement virus scanning for uploaded files
