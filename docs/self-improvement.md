# AMAS Self-Improvement System (v1)

## Purpose
Describes the self-improvement and learning subsystem that enables agents/workflows to adapt, optimize, and improve over time.

---

## Capabilities
- **Performance monitoring**: Track completion rates, errors, efficiency, cost
- **Trend detection**: Identify declines or improvements via statistical analysis
- **A/B testing**: Test agent strategies/tools
- **Knowledge base builder**: Persist outcomes from successful tasks for future reuse
- **Automated recommendations**: Suggest optimizations for agent workflows

---

## Technology
- **Performance Analyzer**: Metrics collection, moving averages, trend scoring
- **Feedback loop**: Completed task quality, agent outputs, workflow outcomes trigger learning
- **Database & history**: Metrics, trends, and actionable insights stored for auditing and improvement coordination

---

## Example Workflow
1. Task completes
2. Metrics logged
3. Analyzer updates trends and computes anomalies
4. System triggers A/B or internal tests on new strategies
5. If significant improvement is found, agent codebase and configs are updated accordingly
6. Knowledge and improvement suggestions are made available to all agents
