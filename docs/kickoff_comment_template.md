# 🚀 Bulletproof AI Analysis - Phase 2 Kickoff

## @amas Commands for Phase 2 Analysis

Please run the following bulletproof AI analysis commands to validate Phase 2 upgrades:

### 🔐 Security Analysis
@amas security Validate JWT/OIDC config (aud/iss/exp/nbf), security headers (CSP/HSTS), input validation coverage, rate limiting strategy, and audit logging integrity.

### ⚡ Performance Analysis  
@amas performance Assess overhead added by middleware and metrics; check async non-blocking logging; ensure cardinality-safe labels.

### 📈 Observability Analysis
@amas analyze Phase 2: end-to-end PR review (security, reliability, observability). Focus on: structured logging schema, metrics naming, health check contract, alert thresholds and runbooks.

### 📚 Documentation Generation
@amas docs Generate a concise summary of monitoring + security improvements, with pointers to dashboards and alert rules.

## 🎯 Expected Bulletproof Validation

All analyses will show:
- ✅ **Real AI Verified**: true
- ✅ **Bulletproof Validated**: true  
- ✅ **Provider**: nvidia/cerebras/etc.
- ✅ **Variable response time** (not identical)
