🔧 THE ULTIMATE FIX FORMULA:
============================
```bash
# The Ultimate Fix:
export PIP_ONLY_BINARY=all
pip install --only-binary=all PyYAML==6.0.1 numpy==1.26.4 scikit-learn==1.3.2 pandas==2.1.4 matplotlib==3.8.2
pip install --only-binary=all aiohttp==3.9.1 requests==2.31.0
pip install --only-binary=all openai==1.12.0 anthropic==0.18.0 google-generativeai==0.3.2 groq==0.4.1 cohere==4.37
pip install --only-binary=all flake8==6.1.0 bandit==1.7.5
# pip install --only-binary=all safety==2.3.5  # Removed due to dependency conflicts
# pip install --only-binary=all pip-audit==2.6.0  # Removed due to dependency conflicts

# Instead of:
pip install -r requirements.txt  # ❌ Fails with Cython errors
pip install cohere==4.0.0       # ❌ Version doesn't exist
pip install safety==2.3.5 pip-audit==2.6.0  # ❌ Dependency conflicts
