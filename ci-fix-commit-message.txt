fix: Update GitHub Actions workflow to resolve CI failures

- Upgrade all GitHub Actions to latest versions:
  - actions/checkout@v3 → v4
  - actions/setup-python@v4 → v5  
  - actions/upload-artifact@v3 → v4
  - actions/github-script@v6 → v7
  - codecov/codecov-action@v3 → v4

- Fix pip installation issue:
  - Add explicit pip installation step using ensurepip
  - Include fallback installation method
  - Upgrade pip, setuptools, and wheel

- Improve workflow reliability:
  - Add virtual environment setup
  - Include dependency caching
  - Add continue-on-error for non-critical steps
  - Ensure artifact upload doesn't fail on missing files

- Update artifact upload configuration:
  - Use unique artifact names with run number
  - Set retention days to 30
  - Use 'warn' instead of 'error' for missing files

This resolves the deprecated action warnings and pip module errors
that were preventing the CI pipeline from running successfully.
