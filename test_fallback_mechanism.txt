âœ… Simple Math: 4


âœ… Hello World: Hello World


âœ… Python Code: ```python
def add_numbers(x, y):
  """
  This function adds two numbers.

  Args:
    x: The first number.
    y: The second number.

  Returns:
    The sum of x and y.
  """
  return x + y

# Example usage:
result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def add_numbers(x, y):`**: This line defines a function named `add_numbers` that takes two arguments, `x` and `y`.
2. **`"""Docstring"""`**:  The triple quotes enclose a docstring, which is a multiline string that describes what the function does.  It's good practice to include docstrings to make your code more understandable.
3. **`return x + y`**: This

âœ… Weather Question: I need a little more information to give you an accurate weather forecast! Tell me:

*   **Where are you located?** (City, State/Province, or even just your ZIP code)

Once I know your location, I can look up the current weather conditions for you.

âœ… Complex Task: Imagine a light switch. A normal computer bit is like a light switch that can be either **on (1)** or **off (0)**.  It can only be in one state at a time.

Quantum computers use **qubits**.  Think of a qubit as a dimmer switch instead of a regular light switch.  It can be **on (1), off (0), or *both* at the same time**. This "both at the same time" state is called **superposition**.

Imagine flipping a coin. Before it lands, it's both heads *and* tails at the same time. That's superposition.  A qubit can be in a superposition of 0 and 1 until we "look" at it (measure it), at which point it collapses into either a 0 or a 1.

Another key concept is **entanglement**. Imagine two of these dimmer switches are magically linked.  If you set one to "on"
