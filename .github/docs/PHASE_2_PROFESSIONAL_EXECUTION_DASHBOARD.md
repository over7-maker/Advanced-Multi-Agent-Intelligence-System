## 🛡️ RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

### Risk Register

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Severity | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|------------|--------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Merge Conflicts | 5% | Medium | Low | Code mapping pre-analysis | Tech Lead |
| Missing Dependencies | 3% | Low | Low | Archive reference + validation | Dev Lead |
| Performance Regression | 2% | Medium | Low | Parallel testing + optimization | Perf Lead |
| Timeline Slip | 10% | Medium | Medium | 48-hour buffer + daily tracking | PM |
| Data Loss | <1% | Critical | Critical | Archive backup + version control | Backup Lead |
| Team Unavailability | 5% | High | Medium | Backup team + flexible schedule | HR Lead |

### Contingency Plans

```
✅ IF merge conflicts occur:
   → Use pre-created consolidation mapping
   → Manual resolution with code review
   → Expected resolution: <15 min per conflict
   → Escalate to tech lead if needed

✅ IF performance degrades:
   → Rollback to archive
   → Optimize consolidation approach
   → Run performance benchmark
   → Expected recovery: <45 min

✅ IF timeline slips:
   → Activate 48-hour buffer (Dec 24-25)
   → Extend to Dec 26-27 if needed
   → Prioritize core deliverables
   → Defer polish work if necessary

✅ IF team member unavailable:
   → Activate backup team member
   → Redistribute tasks
   → Update standup with new assignments
   → Continue execution
