## Upgrade Guide

### From 1.x to 2.0

1. **Update Task Submission Code**:
   ```python
   # Old (1.x)
   task_id = await orchestrator.submit_task(
       description="Task",
       task_type="type",
       title="Title",
       parameters={"key": "value"}
   )
   
   # New (2.0)
   task_id = await orchestrator.submit_task(
       description="Task",
       task_type="type",
       priority=TaskPriority.MEDIUM,
       metadata={
           "title": "Title",
           "parameters": {"key": "value"},
           "required_agent_roles": ["agent_type"]
       }
   )
   ```

2. **Update Agent Imports**:
   ```python
   # Old
   from amas.agents.base.react_agent import ReactAgent
   
   # New
   from amas.agents.base.intelligence_agent import IntelligenceAgent
   ```

3. **Update Configuration**:
   - Migrate from `.env` only to structured YAML/JSON configs
   - Update provider configurations to new format
   - Review and update agent configurations

4. **Test Suite Updates**:
   - Ensure all async tests properly await fixtures
   - Update mock objects to match new interfaces
   - Review and update integration tests

### Breaking Changes
